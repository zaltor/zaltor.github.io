title: Novel Computational Phase Imaging Techniques
description: recent developments in optimization algorithms as well as increases in computing power enable novel phase imaging techniques based on solving inverse problems founded on rigorous physical principles.
---
<p>
Phase imaging, or more precisely, imaging relative differences in
optical path length, is an important tool with many applications.  For
example, many biological specimens of interest are nearly transparent,
and phase imaging is one method by which such specimens can be imaged
noninvasively with high contrast.  Recent developments in optimization
as well as ever-increasing computational power enable novel phase
imaging techniques based on solving inverse problems modeled directly
after first principles.  For example, the factored form descent solver
from <a href="coherence.html">coherence retrieval</a> can be extended
to explicitly enforce coherence and thus can be used for phase
retrieval from measurements through arbitrary (known) optical systems.

<figcaption>An inverse problem approach using shifted wavefront sensor
images (i.e. light field images of a coherent source) yields the phase
profile of a hypergeometric Gaussian (HyGG) beam (a) and a human cheek
cell (b).  The former is from simulated noisy measurements, and the
latter is from experimentally captured images.  Both images yielded
details finer than the lens array pitch, which was roughly 1/16 of the
width of the image in (a) and 1/32 of the width of the image in (b). A
different phase imaging technique combining wavefront sensing and the
transport of intensity equation (TIE) method yields a high quality
phase profile reconstruction of beads over an aberrated wavefront (c),
combining high frequency information from the TIE method (d) and low
frequency information from the wavefront sensor (e).</figcaption>
